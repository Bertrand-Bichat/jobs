# Qraft technical tests

> Idea and tests are _heavily inspired_ (a.k.a "copy-pasted") from the awesome [Getaround (ex Drivy) 🚗 challenges](https://github.com/drivy/jobs) 🙏 😎 and from [Libeo's technical test](https://github.com/libeo-tech/take-home-test-inato).

If you want to join the engineering team at [Qraft](https://qraft.tech) you will most likely have to complete one of our tests. Choose the language you are the most comfortable with:

- [Ruby](ruby/)
- [JavaScript](javascript/)

You can check [our website](https://qraft.tech) to see what we do at _Qraft_ . We are **always** hiring talented people 😎.
